# MTH594_MachineLearning
The materials for the course MTH 594 Advanced data mining: theory and applications taught by Dmitry Efimov in American University of Sharjah, UAE.

To compose this lectures mainly I used the ideas from three sources: 

1. Stanford lectures by Andrew Ng on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599 (lectures 1-6, 8-11)
2. The book "The elements of Statistical Learning" by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman (lecture 7)
3. Lectures by Andrew Ng on Coursera (lecture 5)

All uploaded pdf lectures are adapted in a way to help students to understand the material.

The supplementary files from ipython folder are aimed to understand students how to use built-in methods to train the models on Python 2.7.
